Door Alarm with ATtiny85 and Piezo
This project uses an ATtiny85 microcontroller to create a simple door alarm. The microcontroller monitors two door contacts (magnetic switches) and triggers a piezo buzzer when either door is opened. The alarm is activated after a 3-second delay and stops when both doors are closed. The ATtiny85 operates in the SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN to minimize power consumption, making it suitable for battery-powered applications.

Functionality
Door Monitoring: Two pins of the ATtiny85 (Pin 0 and Pin 2) are used to monitor the state of the door contacts. If one of the doors is opened, the microcontroller is alerted via an interrupt.

Piezo Alarm: If a door is opened and the delay time (3 seconds) has passed, a piezo buzzer is activated, emitting a 1-second beep followed by a 1-second pause. This cycle repeats as long as the door remains open.

Sleep Mode: If neither door is open and the piezo buzzer is not active, the microcontroller enters SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN, reducing power consumption. The microcontroller is only awakened by changes in the door contacts (via interrupts).

Schematic
DOOR1_PIN (PB2): Input for the first door's magnetic switch.
DOOR2_PIN (PB0): Input for the second door's magnetic switch.
PIEZO_PIN (PB1): Output for the piezo buzzer.
Code Details
Delay: A 3-second delay is implemented before activating the piezo buzzer. During this time, the state of the doors is checked.

Interrupts: The microcontroller uses pin-change interrupts to respond to changes in the state of the door contacts.

Sleep Mode: If no door is open and the piezo is inactive, the microcontroller enters SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN to minimize power consumption.
