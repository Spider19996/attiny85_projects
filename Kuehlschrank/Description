Door Alarm with ATtiny85 and Piezo
This project uses an ATtiny85 microcontroller to create a simple door alarm. The microcontroller monitors two door contacts (magnetic switches) and triggers a piezo buzzer when either door is opened. The alarm is activated after a 3-second delay and stops when both doors are closed. The ATtiny85 operates in the SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN to minimize power consumption, making it suitable for battery-powered applications.

Functionality
Door Monitoring: Two pins of the ATtiny85 (Pin 0 and Pin 2) are used to monitor the state of the door contacts. If one of the doors is opened, the microcontroller is alerted via an interrupt.

Piezo Alarm: If a door is opened and the delay time (3 seconds) has passed, a piezo buzzer is activated, emitting a 1-second beep followed by a 1-second pause. This cycle repeats as long as the door remains open.

Sleep Mode: If neither door is open and the piezo buzzer is not active, the microcontroller enters SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN, reducing power consumption. The microcontroller is only awakened by changes in the door contacts (via interrupts).

Low Power Consumption: The microcontroller is designed to operate with minimal power consumption, making it capable of running for long periods without restarting.

Schematic
DOOR1_PIN (PB2): Input for the first door's magnetic switch.
DOOR2_PIN (PB0): Input for the second door's magnetic switch.
PIEZO_PIN (PB1): Output for the piezo buzzer.
Code Details
Delay: A 3-second delay is implemented before activating the piezo buzzer. During this time, the state of the doors is checked.

Interrupts: The microcontroller uses pin-change interrupts to respond to changes in the state of the door contacts.

Sleep Mode: If no door is open and the piezo is inactive, the microcontroller enters SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN to minimize power consumption.

Hardware
ATtiny85 Microcontroller
2 x Magnetic Door Contacts (Switches)
1 x Piezo Buzzer
Installation
Connect the ATtiny85 to your programmer (e.g., USBasp or a similar programming solution).
Upload the code to the ATtiny85.
Connect the door contacts to the appropriate pins and the piezo buzzer to the PIEZO_PIN (PB1).
Ensure that the microcontroller is properly powered.
Important Notes
Sleep Mode: The microcontroller can run for extended periods without restarting when using SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN, significantly reducing power consumption.

Interrupts: The microcontroller is woken up by changes in the door contacts (magnetic switches), meaning the alarm will trigger immediately when a door is opened.

Delay Time: The delay time before the alarm is activated is set to 3 seconds. This value can be easily adjusted by changing the delayTime variable.

Potential Improvements
Add more doors by using additional pins for door contacts.
Integrate an LED or display to show the status of the doors.
Expand the project to implement a custom alarm duration or different beep patterns for the piezo buzzer.
